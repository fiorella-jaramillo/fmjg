What do I require these days to integrate it in my dayle life?. So, start from the previous ideas and experiments regarding how can we coexist peacefully? , these days I was looking for friendly options for generating energy. It was a complex task because of the lack of solutions to generate what we require in our daily life or at least a bit. I began creating an environment to interact carefully with nature, represented by plants in the machine, and while I was looking for materials to create it, the ideas and concepts start to appear and compliment themselves. This environment is represented in the machine on the black side of the surface, and also, the connectors that are coming out of it are the roots and expansion of the surface. In these roots, there are containers of energy, frequencies, and waves, generated by this natural source. And these containers are wire-connected to me through devices I have on my ears (LEDs). For the system to work I have to take care of the natural source in order to obtain this energy-frequencies-waves to me. IMAGE OF THE MACHINE FOR ME DETAILS OF THE MACHINE FOR ME IMAGE OF THE GROUP MACHINES In our group, BIO, TECH, ANCESTRY, we care about the balance energy; the interaction carefully with nature; the music, frequency, and waves that expand from the environment, the understanding of cycles, the knowledge of the respect to the earth; we still looking for the connection to nature and everything that it is related to it. It was surprisingly the similarity between our projects and the exploration that the design action could have and the projection of our conscience in our projects. What I had acquired with this creative process was the playful way to approach solutions and the exploration of ideas by doing it. THE VIDEO In search of how can we coexist peacefully , I did a video in the first-personal exploration of how can I connect with nature living in the city. So, I start a collection of messages from nature picking trees and plants, using as a tool akashic records channeling HOW CAN I CONNECT TO NATURE IN THE CITY? HOW CAN I CONNECT WITH NATURE LIVING IN THE CITY? THE GUIDED REFLECTION Define Boundaries. It was a personal appreciation of how I can connect with nature been in the city, going around places I use to spend time. What I had realized was that as a citizen we have a certain speed of doing our activities, so, to feel close o nature I had to reduce the speed of the daily routines . It started from my building to the beach, 10 blocks to the around . The connection took more time than I thought at the beginning, and it required much more energy to do it. Authenticity The first day was difficult to start the activities with the picked trees, also, I was ashamed to hug the tree because of the people around, the noises, etc. I had to diminish the velocity of my movements, walking slower, stopping several times to appreciate nature. The next day was easier I was already trained in how to do it. Something to remind was that the second day I felt comfortable, even proud of how can I was handling the process and, sometimes I felt like a child without any prejudices and it became a game. Plausibility or scholarship It seems to me, that there is a movement of engagement with nature because of global warming and so on. In addition, new holistic practices as meditation, spirituality, or recent discoveries of quantum physics, that give us a new perspective on how can we address life differently. Criticality It felt like a ritual. It became very personal, and I guess that at the beginning I didn\u00b4t know how everything could work. It was a beautiful experience for me, and maybe it could help many ones, but I speculate that is not that inclusive, or maybe it is if I put a sign/thing (chair) on every tree to hug or just look at it. How will people react? Anyway, What I can keep from this activity as a possible utility are options to disconnect from the speed of the city to connect to nature or yourself. Self-revealing communication Even though they are open phrases, they were somehow related to me. It seems to me, that what was kept away from the video doesn\u2019t affect the result. But, at the same time, I feel that each tree has a story itself\u2026 Some of the phrases don\u2019t appear. While I was doing the activity, sometimes, I was thinking of how it is going to be shown, or took extra photos and videos. Ethnographic material with confessional content In the beginning, I thought that the information that I could receive from the trees could be related to the city, but they were very general and resonated with me, I guess I could ask other questions, or prepare better the experience. Contemplation, and reducing the speed of our daily routines to appreciate not just nature, appreciate me , my time, as well, or to appreciate the city itself. I felt very grateful. Sometimes, I felt being in a bubble or \u201cin my own world\u201d , playing around with trees and plants as a child. Generalizability For me, the main message was \u201cgo-to basics\u00a8\u201d, why it is ok to hug a tree if you are a child and not now. So, what I kept are the sensations and requirements to connect, not the way. Maybe, It could be a meaningful experience to others, however, I can\u00b4t tell that it is inclusive and that everyone Will feel what I felt or similar. FOR MY FUTURE WORK \u2026 I enjoyed the idea of exploring to see what was happening , the transition of a project before And, the mutability of it during it is in action.

It started from my building to the beach, 10 blocks to the around . The connection took more time than I thought at the beginning, and it required much more energy to do it. Authenticity The first day was difficult to start the activities with the picked trees, also, I was ashamed to hug the tree because of the people around, the noises, etc. I had to diminish the velocity of my movements, walking slower, stopping several times to appreciate nature. The next day was easier I was already trained in how to do it. Something to remind was that the second day I felt comfortable, even proud of how can I was handling the process and, sometimes I felt like a child without any prejudices and it became a game. Plausibility or scholarship It seems to me, that there is a movement of engagement with nature because of global warming and so on. In addition, new holistic practices as meditation, spirituality, or recent discoveries of quantum physics, that give us a new perspective on how can we address life differently. Criticality It felt like a ritual. It became very personal, and I guess that at the beginning I didn\u00b4t know how everything could work. It was a beautiful experience for me, and maybe it could help many ones, but I speculate that is not that inclusive, or maybe it is if I put a sign/thing (chair) on every tree to hug or just look at it. How will people react? Anyway, What I can keep from this activity as a possible utility are options to disconnect from the speed of the city to connect to nature or yourself. Self-revealing communication Even though they are open phrases, they were somehow related to me. It seems to me, that what was kept away from the video doesn\u2019t affect the result. But, at the same time, I feel that each tree has a story itself\u2026 Some of the phrases don\u2019t appear. While I was doing the activity, sometimes, I was thinking of how it is going to be shown, or took extra photos and videos. Ethnographic material with confessional content In the beginning, I thought that the information that I could receive from the trees could be related to the city, but they were very general and resonated with me, I guess I could ask other questions, or prepare better the experience. Contemplation, and reducing the speed of our daily routines to appreciate not just nature, appreciate me , my time, as well, or to appreciate the city itself. I felt very grateful. Sometimes, I felt being in a bubble or \u201cin my own world\u201d , playing around with trees and plants as a child. Generalizability For me, the main message was \u201cgo-to basics\u00a8\u201d, why it is ok to hug a tree if you are a child and not now. So, what I kept are the sensations and requirements to connect, not the way. Maybe, It could be a meaningful experience to others, however, I can\u00b4t tell that it is inclusive and that everyone Will feel what I felt or similar. FOR MY FUTURE WORK \u2026 I enjoyed the idea of exploring to see what was happening , the transition of a project before And, the mutability of it during it is in action. PD:::: my faces and the trees.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/","text":"Tech Beyond the Myth \u00b6 Forensic Report: Apple Computer 2006 \u00b6 Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier Forensics of the Obsolescence Identity of the submitter Someone at the Fab Lab Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Fiorella, Rei, Emilio, Andrea Examination \u00b6 serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 Color: White Assemblied in: China Specifications: Canadian ICES-003 Class B Forensic Questions \u00b6 It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing.

Sense-Making Journal - Urban Gardeners \u00b6 :::info A report by the Urban Gardeners team \ud83c\udf31 : Gerda, Fiorella, Paula, Emilio, Audrey and Busisiwe ::: Journal Index Tech Beyond the Myth Forensic Report: Apple Computer 2006 Examination Forensic Questions Steps taken Results Conclusions Opinion Sense-Making Journal - Urban Gardeners From objectives to the hypothesis Brainstorming Project Goals Tips From hypothesis to data Tools selection Tool usage documentation Data capturing strategy Materials needed Detail setup instructions Data collected Tips Data capture Data summary Optimal Conditions Data insights Tips and biais From objectives to the hypothesis \u00b6 Brainstorming \u00b6 Project Goals \u00b6 objective: I WANT TO PRODUCE MY FOOD. Can I produce the ingredients of my meals at home or my neighborhood? hypothesis: I CAN PRODUCE THE INGREDIENTS OF MY MEALS AT HOME OR MY NEIGHBORHOOD. Tips \u00b6 We recommend that, in order to realize the experiment properly, we require to collect data during the year, because of the time of growth of the plants. Nutritional data is required to estimate possible species to grow, and therefore the space demanded for a person to grow his food. In addition, being aware that particles in the air and other gases might affect the correct development of plants. And, try to not be around the sensor while it is doing the measurement because it affect the results. From hypothesis to data \u00b6 Tools selection \u00b6 We chose the CITIZEN SENSING TOOLKIT http://making-sense.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Citizen-Sensing-A-Toolkit.pdf We selected it because we wanted to figure out how is the weather (temperature, humidity, light, eCO2, eVO2) in the possible free spots to grow food in the neighborhood and compare it to what the plants require to grow there. Tool usage documentation \u00b6 The process can be replicated using the same Citizen Sensing Toolkit , what we recommend is to do it at different times a day and in all the seasons if it is referred to growing plants. Check the outliers when you download the information. Data capturing strategy \u00b6 First, we choose the places that are already working as urban gardens, then we start thinking of possible places that might be used to check if they can be used to growing the food, and what types of food might be there. The data was taken from 14:30pm to 16:30pm in 7 places that we checked before start. Then we download the data in the laptop to start the cleaning of the information. Materials needed \u00b6 Smart citizen kit sensor USB cable Computer to configure the SCK Cell phone to connect the SCK using WiFi connection, and take pictures and videos to documentation. Detail setup instructions \u00b6 The first step is to connect the battery. The kit will light in red (configuration mode) Sign up to the Smart Citizen Platfom When the light is red, the CSK is ready to set up, either by WiFi or SD Card connection When the light is blue, the SCK is on Wi-Fi connection. In this way, the device will publish the data every minute on the smartcitizen.me platform When the SCK is pink, it is on offline mode and is saving the information on the SD Card When we measured, we pressed the button once until the light turnd pink, we measured for 10 minutes then switched it to standy turning the light red Find a good and clear location to place the Citizen Sensing Toolkit . If you need to measure light, make sure it is \u201cface up\u201d. Data collected \u00b6 Using the Smart citizen kit, we planned to visit 6 different locations to gather data on light quality, humidity, Temperature and particle matter.

D\u2019ICARIA CEMETERY PARC MARIPOSA CARRER DE PUJADES The raw data is provided in spreadsheets: Tips \u00b6 We would have to measure with multiple devices in order to have the conditions in different places at the same time of the day and for a longer time Data capture \u00b6 Data summary \u00b6 Data Summary Project Title Urban Gardeners Capture Start 11-11-2021 Capture End 12-11-2021 Original Data Format CSV file Submitted format CSV file Total Data Points 359 Number of datasets 2 Data Repository https://github.com/fablabbcn/mdef-a-world-in-data/tree/main/urban-gardeners Optimal Conditions \u00b6 Data insights \u00b6 We compared the data captured in the 7 spots. To improve the data: - We would need to take measurements of all year and at the same time in different places. - In order to have an efficient use of the space for producing the plants, we would have to measure characteristics of the soil as well (nutrients, chemicals, ph, etc.) - Other parameters could be taken into account: available time of people to take care of it, space available. Raw data We used google sheet pivot tables to agregate data into averages by location and also to focus on specific parameters. Average of data by location Focus of each location data to remove potential outliers Comparision bubble chart x = temperature y = light diameter of the bubbles = CO2 particules We displayed the ideal location conditions needed for the 4 vegetables we studied above. Potatoes, carrots : not any location studied respond to the requirement of light needed Lettuce, tomatoes : only the rooftop of IAAC would allow us to grow these! We need to continue the research on the vegetables that we can grow in the winter season with very little light. Tips and biais \u00b6 We didn\u2019t pay attention to the noise sensor so we made some noise discussing just next to the sensor during the data capturing. It would be interesting to stay silent or go further during the recording so we can see how much frequentation there is in the different locations. Scale the process : To record more accurate and more comparable data, it would be better to record a full day and not just 10 minutes to know how much light the location gets. Here we just recorded 10 minutes in each spot and not at the same time of the day (between 1pm and 4:30pm).","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#forensic-report-apple-computer-2006","text":"Identity of the reporting agency MDEF Case identifier Forensics of the Obsolescence Identity of the submitter Someone at the Fab Lab Date of receipt 09/11/2021 Date of report 09/11/2021 Identity and signature of the examiner Fiorella, Rei, Emilio, Andrea","title":"Forensic Report: Apple Computer 2006"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#examination","text":"serial number: CK6s0083WH4 Brand: Apple (in California) Model: A1195 Color: White Assemblied in: China Specifications: Canadian ICES-003 Class B","title":"Examination"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#forensic-questions","text":"It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing.
