My fight is to question how can we coexist with the nature without disturb or damage the environment of the animals, plants, fungi; or ourselves, as well. Can we coexist peacefully?

Furthermore, it is part of several cultures around the world right know. So, how much does nature can resist us? , can we change the vibrations, fecruencies and behaviors, henceforth? Some how, It seems to me, that part of our fight is to imagine what kind of solutions we can offer to redesign manners to do it propertly, lovely, respectfully. And start them now.

MULTISCALAR DIAGRAM We started in the Collserola National Park, a protected park nearby the city of Barcelona. So, it enters the Region / National part in the multiscalar diagram.

What I found here is a variety of a couple of fruits, plants; lots of roots in surfaces as a reminder of an underground natural connection. We could enjoy the transit of the birds and their sounds. Also, an electricity tower system was buzzing. Apparently, this was a reminder that we were still close to the city. And of course, to supply our demands. The question could be, Is there another way? Are these vibrations and buzzing affect the animals and plants? Or us ?. Going home, plants still going around, and the buzzing started to disappear, but, was it disappear or just we get used to the sound? or maybe other kinds of buzzing or vibrations appeared, to normalize it?

What do I require these days to integrate it in my dayle life?. So, start from the previous ideas and experiments regarding how can we coexist peacefully? , these days I was looking for friendly options for generating energy. It was a complex task because of the lack of solutions to generate what we require in our daily life or at least a bit. I began creating an environment to interact carefully with nature, represented by plants in the machine, and while I was looking for materials to create it, the ideas and concepts start to appear and compliment themselves. This environment is represented in the machine on the black side of the surface, and also, the connectors that are coming out of it are the roots and expansion of the surface. In these roots, there are containers of energy, frequencies, and waves, generated by this natural source. And these containers are wire-connected to me through devices I have on my ears (LEDs). For the system to work I have to take care of the natural source in order to obtain this energy-frequencies-waves to me. IMAGE OF THE MACHINE FOR ME DETAILS OF THE MACHINE FOR ME IMAGE OF THE GROUP MACHINES In our group, BIO, TECH, ANCESTRY, we care about the balance energy; the interaction carefully with nature; the music, frequency, and waves that expand from the environment, the understanding of cycles, the knowledge of the respect to the earth; we still looking for the connection to nature and everything that it is related to it. It was surprisingly the similarity between our projects and the exploration that the design action could have and the projection of our conscience in our projects. What I had acquired with this creative process was the playful way to approach solutions and the exploration of ideas by doing it. THE VIDEO In search of how can we coexist peacefully , I did a video in the first-personal exploration of how can I connect with nature living in the city. So, I start a collection of messages from nature picking trees and plants, using as a tool akashic records channeling HOW CAN I CONNECT TO NATURE IN THE CITY? HOW CAN I CONNECT WITH NATURE LIVING IN THE CITY? THE GUIDED REFLECTION Define Boundaries. It was a personal appreciation of how I can connect with nature been in the city, going around places I use to spend time. What I had realized was that as a citizen we have a certain speed of doing our activities, so, to feel close o nature I had to reduce the speed of the daily routines . It started from my building to the beach, 10 blocks to the around . The connection took more time than I thought at the beginning, and it required much more energy to do it. Authenticity The first day was difficult to start the activities with the picked trees, also, I was ashamed to hug the tree because of the people around, the noises, etc. I had to diminish the velocity of my movements, walking slower, stopping several times to appreciate nature. The next day was easier I was already trained in how to do it. Something to remind was that the second day I felt comfortable, even proud of how can I was handling the process and, sometimes I felt like a child without any prejudices and it became a game. Plausibility or scholarship It seems to me, that there is a movement of engagement with nature because of global warming and so on. In addition, new holistic practices as meditation, spirituality, or recent discoveries of quantum physics, that give us a new perspective on how can we address life differently. Criticality It felt like a ritual. It became very personal, and I guess that at the beginning I didn\u00b4t know how everything could work. It was a beautiful experience for me, and maybe it could help many ones, but I speculate that is not that inclusive, or maybe it is if I put a sign/thing (chair) on every tree to hug or just look at it. How will people react? Anyway, What I can keep from this activity as a possible utility are options to disconnect from the speed of the city to connect to nature or yourself. Self-revealing communication Even though they are open phrases, they were somehow related to me. It seems to me, that what was kept away from the video doesn\u2019t affect the result. But, at the same time, I feel that each tree has a story itself\u2026 Some of the phrases don\u2019t appear. While I was doing the activity, sometimes, I was thinking of how it is going to be shown, or took extra photos and videos. Ethnographic material with confessional content In the beginning, I thought that the information that I could receive from the trees could be related to the city, but they were very general and resonated with me, I guess I could ask other questions, or prepare better the experience. Contemplation, and reducing the speed of our daily routines to appreciate not just nature, appreciate me , my time, as well, or to appreciate the city itself. I felt very grateful. Sometimes, I felt being in a bubble or \u201cin my own world\u201d , playing around with trees and plants as a child. Generalizability For me, the main message was \u201cgo-to basics\u00a8\u201d, why it is ok to hug a tree if you are a child and not now. So, what I kept are the sensations and requirements to connect, not the way.

This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies. This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet. I have an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and 3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port This device could be used for personal use or work. This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation. The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone. Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use. Steps taken \u00b6 Opening the laptop First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. We could check that the iMac worked but we couldn\u2019t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility. We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws. After that, we had to disassemble the camera and other devices such as the microphone that was attached to the case. Then we could separate the screen and some parts of the aluminium that covered the electronic system. Datasheet for the logicboard (motherboard) Apple iMac A1195 Logic board Conclusions \u00b6 It was all different kinds of functions and its parts combined in one box. Each functional part was connected to the motherboard with plugs in so that it sends signals to tell what to do through the cords. Most of the parts are made by different suppliers. Camera, speakers, disc utility, microphone, and hard drive are easy to recognize. When we accidentally dropped the CPU to the floor, it bent and was unable to be used again. Some parts are really fragile when it\u2019s open. Camera is isolated from the main function. We noticed that this can be turned on without the computer\u2019s signal so we never know if the computer is reliable until we open it. There are more than 100 screws used inside. Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both made in the process of stamped or molded. Plastic parts(box) are polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore. Opinion \u00b6 At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The computer has several seals that show when the user opens it, like small aluminum sheets ori foils that you have to tear it down. If you do so, that will show to the tech support when the user opens it and therefore lose the guarantee of the device. With that, they make sure that the consumer prefer no to open it and to conserve the guarantee. The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can find also few alloys for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic part that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer.

Most of the metal parts are aluminum. Metals are both made in the process of stamped or molded. Plastic parts(box) are polycarbonate. Everything except the screen is covered with an aluminium sheet in order to avoid heat and radiation. Some screws are hidden and some parts are glued so that Apple technical support will be able to know if a user opens the computer by themself so that Apple will not support it anymore.","title":"Conclusions"},{"location":"seminars/05-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#opinion","text":"At opening from the bottom there are two kind of screws, the normal one Phillips screwdriver, but they use a special type of head that is not available to general in public, so that doesn not allow anyone to open the device, you have to take it to Tech support in order to have it open and the computer The camera card is no attached to the led that show when it is turned on, they are two separates circuits, so that opens a discussion about how that hardware is used, if it is fully controlled by the user with a physical switch or controlled by a backend command by the builder The computer has several seals that show when the user opens it, like small aluminum sheets ori foils that you have to tear it down. If you do so, that will show to the tech support when the user opens it and therefore lose the guarantee of the device. With that, they make sure that the consumer prefer no to open it and to conserve the guarantee. The body it Is combined with the PC plastic and steel as a structure, aluminum is used as an isolation back and forward. There are a lot of boards with different materials, connectors , circuits and capacitors and disipators and most of them are fixed by special screws, almost 85% of them, the rest are regular screws. We can find also few alloys for heat displacement like aluminum and copper. There are also tiny plastic part that make the connection to the back part of the computer and the boards or the optical unit to the lateral of the computer. DETAILS","title":"Opinion"}]}
