# REFLECTIONS: 

RGoing backward, what I can say is that everything happened too fast, that I couldn´t catch all of the new cool knowledge.  I tried to follow the dynamics of the master, and, I think I forgot what I am doing in daily life so far, and also, other experimentations that I was developing before coming here.  
</P>
<P> I am very interested in waste in general as a potential for new materials; but not just for the development of them, I see waste as a tool of meaning to show, to express, to make aware of what is happening right now on earth.
</P>
<P> On the other hand, I noticed that what emerged from these master processes was my interest in making visible and normal the spiritual, holistic, which is also very new to me as well. It is like my new vocabulary. 
</P>
<P> At the same time, it seems to me that it can be reflected in my activities and projects, but at the end of the term, it was surprising to me to go for that path.  
 </P>
 <P> I wanted to share this image that emerge in the end of the last term, because, I feel it reflects the motor of my movements. 
</P>

<h2>NEW SCOPE</h2>
  <P>
    Now that I know more or less how the master goes, I feel more free of experimenting with anything, and what I had learned recently is that nothing is superficial, it is a protection of our subconsciousness.
  </P>  
 <p>I require more types of documentation.</p>
<h2>GOALS</h2>

<h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>
  <P>
    The next thing is to continue with what has emerged regarding spirituals, in parallel with the maker ideas linked to FABLAB. And at some point, I imagine that they will overlap or not, but the option will remain open in my path as a designer.
    Integrate knowledge that I already have, bring it to light so as not to forget, it is good to practice.
    Integrate more technology into interventions.

<h2>THREE MAIN LEARNING POINTS FROM THE 1ST TRIMESTER</h2>
  <P>
    - Always make material the homework, even if your thoughts are not clear, your subconscious will talk.  </br>
    - Don´t be pressured, the master is designed for you to interact with your skills.</br>
    - Community is fundamental, find it!.

<h2>PROJECT GOALS FOR THE NEXT INTERVENTION</h2>
  <P>
    I plan to do two interventions, the first is to continue what emerged in the last term regarding the holistic approach, and the second is what triggered my attempt to manage my waste to see what I do.
