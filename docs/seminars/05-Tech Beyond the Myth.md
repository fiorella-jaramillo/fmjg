## Forensic Questions
:::warning
**What does it do?** 

It is a personal computer , used for personal work like word processors, it has a camera and microphone built in, for video calls for example, and also has a pair of speakers for sound reproducing.
This model has an optical unit or CD/DVD ROM that can reproduce and burn cd/dvd. This could be used for playing videos or movies.
This computer has a WIFI modem, so it can be connected to the internet.
I have an Intel processor and 8 GB of RAM. It have a monitor and  3 USB ports, 2 input/output for audio and video, and Ethernet port
This device could be used for personal use or work.
This computer in particular still works fine but the capacity of the new equipment makes it obsolete and slow, not adequate to work with the requirements of the equipment, which is  the case of some of the electronic devices. It is not used because it is cheaper and accessible  to buy new equipment at a lower cost. Also hardware like the main processor is expensive and difficult to replace for a new one in order to maintain the device in optimal operation.The RAM memory could be replaced but it is difficult for anyone.
Also Apple stops at certain points to release actualizations to the IOS so that lead to small failures and errors in everyday use.

## Steps taken
:::warning

**Opening the laptop**
First of all we checked if the computer worked. It can be switched on and on the screen appears the log in accounts. 
We could check that the iMac worked but we couldnâ€™t check if any program could be run. So, we cannot affirm if the iMac was discarded because of the requirements or utility.

We had to check a video to know how to start the disassembly of the computer. We started removing the front part of the case. In order to unscrew we had to find a specific screwdriver because of the special screws.
