WHAT IS MY FIGHT?


My fight is to question how, we as a human, can coexist with the nature without damage it or disturb animal, plants, etc. I mean, how much does nature can resist us?
And, in a way, try to imagine what kind of solutions we can offer.

In the poster, there is an image that I took two days ago when I went to the beach; a pigeon came very close o me, and I took it as a welcome.
As a designer, I have learned, as a priority, to understand how to address a design to optimize the experience of users in the plan of any project. However, recently, appeared in action more factors that we have to look for and fight for. Environment and its natural users as well.



HYBRID PROFILES

How do I recognize myself as a designer?
Am I conscious of all the potentials and weaknesses that I have?
