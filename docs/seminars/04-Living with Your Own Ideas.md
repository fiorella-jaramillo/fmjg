# Living with Your Own Ideas


Task: ***To create a machine for me*** using *whatever item you have near.*
*What do I require these days to integrate it in my dayle life?.*

So, start from the previous ideas and experiments regarding *how can we coexist peacefully?*, these days I was looking for friendly options for generating energy. It was a complex task because of the lack of solutions to generate what we require in our daily life or at least a bit. 

I began creating an environment to interact carefully with nature, represented by plants in the machine, and while I was looking for materials to create it, the ideas and concepts start to appear and compliment themselves. This environment is represented in the machine on the black side of the surface, and also, the connectors that are coming out of it are the *roots* and *expansion* of the surface. In these roots, there are containers of energy, frequencies, and waves, generated by this natural source. And these containers are wire-connected to me through devices I have on my ears (LEDs).

For the system to work I have to take care of the natural source in order to obtain this **energy-frequencies-waves** to me.

In our group, ***BIO, TECH, ANCESTRY,*** we care about the balance energy; the interaction carefully with nature; the music, frequency, and waves that expand from the environment, the understanding of cycles, the knowledge of the respect to the earth; we still looking for the connection to nature and everything that it is related to it.

It was surprisingly the similarity between our projects and the exploration that the design action could have and the projection of our conscience in our projects.

What I had acquired with this creative process was the playful way to approach solutions and the exploration of ideas by doing it.
